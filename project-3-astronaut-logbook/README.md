# Astronaut Logbook Project

## Overview
The Astronaut Logbook project is designed to help astronauts maintain a detailed log of their daily activities, experiences, and observations during space missions. This logbook serves as a valuable resource for both personal reflection and scientific documentation.

## Features
- **Daily Logging**: Users can record their daily activities and experiences.
- **Observation Notes**: Space for astronauts to jot down important observations during their missions.
- **Data Storage**: Logs are stored in a structured format for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use in a space environment.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `project-3-astronaut-logbook/src` directory.
3. Run the main script using Python:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter your daily log entries.

## Maintenance
- Ensure that the logbook is updated daily.
- Regularly back up log entries to prevent data loss.
- Review logs periodically for insights and reflections on the mission.

This project aims to enhance the documentation of space missions and provide astronauts with a reliable tool for recording their experiences in space.
