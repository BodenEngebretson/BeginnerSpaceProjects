# Solar System Simulator

This project simulates gravitational orbits between multiple celestial bodies using Newtonian physics and semi-implicit Euler integration. It uses Python and `turtle` graphics to visually display the motion of planets around a central star.

### Features
- Simulates multi-body gravitational interaction
- Realistic orbital motion with adjustable parameters
- Visual trails drawn using turtle graphics

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BodenEngebretson/BeginnerSpaceProjects.git
Navigate to the project:


cd BeginnerSpaceProjects/project-1-solar-system-simulator/src
Run the simulation:


python main.py
