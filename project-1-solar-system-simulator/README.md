# Solar System Simulator

## Overview
The Solar System Simulator is a project designed to visualize the orbits of planets around the sun. It provides an interactive way to understand the dynamics of our solar system and the relative positions of the planets.

## Purpose
This simulator aims to educate users about the solar system's structure and the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. It serves as a fun and engaging tool for learning about astronomy.

## Features
- Visual representation of the solar system with planets orbiting the sun.
- Adjustable parameters for planet speed and distance from the sun.
- Basic graphics to illustrate the orbits and positions of planets.
- User-friendly interface for interaction.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd project-1-solar-system-simulator/src
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (to be specified in the main.py or a requirements.txt file)
